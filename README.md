## HubSpot Alfred Workflow

Jump straight into your favorite HubSpot sub-app right from within Alfred. Save your mouse a few clicks.


### Installing

Download the HubSpot.alfredworkflow file and open it on your computer. Should be as simple as that.


### Configuring

The first time you use this workflow, it'll ask you to set your Hub ID (sometimes referred to as Portal ID). Just type it in and press `ctrl + enter` when prompted. This will allow you to open URLs specific to your portal.

If you ever want to change your set Hub ID, just type `hubspot <your_hub_id>`. As long as `your_hub_id` is a number, you'll be prompted to hold `ctrl + enter` to set your new Hub Id.


### Currently Supported URLs:

- Dashboard

The easiest way to contribute is to send a pull request. Ideally, the JSON for these routes should be served from an API. If you'd like to embark on that, please feel free!
